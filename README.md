# Abstract
After the increase in the use of Bitcoin [1] , digital curriencies are very popular as
research topics nowadays. A lot of new digital currencies have been released for
different needs. In this project, we propose a new digital currency that is a kind of
simplified and partially centralized form of Bitcoin. The creation of coins are done in a
well-known server and the initial users got their keys from the server. Then,users can
transact the coins without permission of the server and everybody can create a new
account and participate the usage of the coin. The server can create new coins
whenever it needs. The architecture can be use for many different purpose such as
ticket systems, documents of limited usage permissions etc.
